# Walkthrough for Institute Website

[Developed by GLUG NITD](https://nitdgplug.org)

Starting with the current website, we have identified the need of a new, modern website with better back-end functionality. The aforesaid issues are documented below

## Issues


## Proposal

This is what we propose for the new website:

* We reference the website of [NIT Rourkela](http://nitrkl.ac.in) as the starting point of the website.
* The entire website will be a multi-level hierarchy.

### Landing Page

* Increasing the carousel image size to fit the width of the container.
* Grouped tile structure (as shown in the [image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IaOwBsMKdhn9FgMMeqTE7BrK5mgGWjf2/view?usp=sharing)) for better accessibility.
* Proper navigation and footer.
* A notice board to show the recent notices.
* 

### Hierarchy

- Academics
  - Departments
  - Admission
  - Examination
  - Institute Information
